    <h2>About ISDRC</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify; max-width:900px"> The Innovation and Skill Development Research Centre (ISDRC) was established in the Department of Physics at Jadavpur University in 2024 to strengthen innovation and skill education as envisioned by the National Education Policy (NEP). It provides students a powerful space to showcase their work, ideas, and research. 
One of the unique and pioneering initiatives of ISDRC is its annual research journal, dedicated primarily to publishing full-length research papers authored by undergraduate and postgraduate students of West Bengal, while also welcoming high-quality contributions from PhD scholars and independent researchers—making it a completely new and first-of-its-kind concept in the region.
ISDRC also houses a workshop with fabrication units equipped with instrument and prototyping tools, where students can transform theoretical ideas into functional prototypes and real-world products. From concept development to product fabrication, the centre supports the entire innovation pipeline.
Beyond academics and research, ISDRC also serves as a launchpad for entrepreneurship. The centre provides a dedicated platform to support new startups, innovative business ideas, and student-led ventures, guiding them toward growth, sustainability, and real market impact.
